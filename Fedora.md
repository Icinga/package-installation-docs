# Installing <!-- {{ product }} --> on Fedora

The recommended way to install <!-- {{ product }} --> is to use prebuilt packages from our official release repository.
If the repository is not configured yet,
please [add](#adding-icinga-package-repository) it first
before [installing](#installing-the-package) the package.

All packages we provide are signed with the following [key](https://packages.icinga.com/icinga.key).

## Adding Icinga Package Repository

Hereâ€™s how to add the official release repository:

```bash
dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
dnf config-manager --add-repo https://packages.icinga.com/fedora/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$VERSION_ID")/release
```

## Installing the Package

Use your distribution's package manager to install the `<!-- {{ package }} -->` package as follows:

```bash
dnf install <!-- {{ package }} -->
```

<!-- {% set fedora = True %} -->
<!-- {% include "02-Installation.md" %} -->
